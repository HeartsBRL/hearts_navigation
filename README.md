RTAB MAP on Jetson nano performance: 

The frame rate usually fluctuates between 19 and 26 and best it can get upto is 30 ![Screenshot from 2022-02-09 17-12-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50763982/153254156-09447f53-7e2d-43d8-89e4-9935942dd0f3.png)

However, this are screenshots and it is highly possible that this might have affected the frame rate, hence i have also taken some pictures from mobile which suggest that frame rate actually range between 26 and 30 (the frame rate reduces when the camera is moving and improves when camera is stationary).
