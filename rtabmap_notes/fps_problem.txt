There might be some lag in the rtabmapviz when camera is connected to pi. 
Reducing FPS seems to be a good solution. this can be done using the following
command during launch of realsense sdk ros wrapper from terminal:

depth_fps:=15 infra_fps:=15

Remember default parameters for both of the parameters are 30fps (atleast 
for one of them) 

least could be 6 but never try that. actually never go below 15 it is 
recomended
