When running the realsense sdk ros wrapper on pi, after certain time you may
get an error saying imu message must be sent faster and camera/imu topic 
freezes. This problem could be resolved by throtling the imu speed 


setting gyro_fps=200 and accel_fps=63 removed this error (atleast for me)

In the launch command use this additional arguments:

gyro_fps:=200  accel_fps:=63
